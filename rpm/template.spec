%description
This package is used to manually control a robot that uses the operator and
navigator node from navigation_2d. Currently there is one node to control one
robot with a joystick and one to control multiple robots in simulation. It can
send commands directly to the operator or start and stop navigator actions.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
