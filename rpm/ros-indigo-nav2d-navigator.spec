%description
This package provides a node for higher level navigation of a mobile robot in a
planar environment. It needs a map and the robot's position within this map to
create a plan for navigation. When used together with a SLAM module it can also
be used to perform autonomous exploration of the robot's workspace.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
